# DEVTOWN-Disease-Predictor-Bootcamp
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project applies Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, ECG results, and exercise-induced angina.

The workflow includes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Performance evaluation with accuracy and feature importance

Real-time predictions for new patient data

📊 Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy in our experiments.

🛠️ Tech Stack / Toolkit

Language: Python

Environment: Google Colab

Libraries:

pandas, numpy → data handling

matplotlib, seaborn → visualization

scikit-learn → machine learning models

joblib → model saving/loading

🚀 How to Run
▶️ Run on Google Colab

Click the "Open in Colab" badge above.

Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data, train models, and view predictions.

💻 Run Locally (Optional)
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/<DEVTOWN-Disease-Predictor-Bootcamp>.git
cd <YourRepoName>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Open Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook <YourNotebookName>.ipynb

📊 Results & Insights

Random Forest showed the best performance among tested models.

Key predictors included age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and ECG features.

The model provides accurate binary predictions (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease).
